# Gray-White-Matter-Boundary
The matlab scripts are for calcualting two new metrics of functional activity that complement traditional structural assessments, and which quantify the similarities and differences in BOLD signals between GM and WM points (voxels) that are near, and aligned perpendicular, to the GM-WM boundary. These features are characterized in two ways. First, we introduce gray-white matter functional connectivity (GWFC) by calculating the Pearson correlation between the BOLD signals of those two points, which reflects the fidelity of signal transmission across the boundary. High values of GWFC indicate the BOLD signal in WM closely follows the time course of neighboring GM.  Second, we propose the gray-white BOLD power ratio (GWBPR), represented as the ratio of the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations23 (fALFF) between these two points, to capture how much of the power of the GM BOLD signal is retained as it transverses the boundary. 
SPM, DPABI and GIFTI toolboxes are required for running the code.
